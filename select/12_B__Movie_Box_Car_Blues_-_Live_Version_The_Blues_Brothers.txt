Caught a ride into South Dakota
With two girls in a light blue Desoto
One's name was Jane, the other was plain
But they both had racing motors

Next I caught a ride with a gamblers wife
She had a brand new lay down rambler
She parked outside of town layed the rambler down
She said she sure could dig it if I'd knew her

I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Look for me Sunday gonna be there honey
Something special just for you, special just for you

Made a truck stop for toothpick and water
I got a ride from a fruit pickers daughter
Drove her through the night, let the fruit just right
She said all I could eat for a quarter

Next on the train with a hobo woman
Said she was from Texas too, the way that she did
What she did, when she did, what she did to me
Made me think of you, ya honey made me think of you

I'm doing my best to get back to you
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Look for me Sunday gonna be there honey
With something special just for you, special just for you
Ya honey, something special just for you
