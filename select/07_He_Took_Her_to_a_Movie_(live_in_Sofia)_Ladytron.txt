He took her to a movie
And when they'd done it all
He took her to a movie
And from the hospital
He took her to a movie
But so did I
And when her heart was sad

He took her to a movie
And should their love turn bad
He took her to a movie
But so did I
I think she's been alone
He took her to a movie
When they cut off the phone
He took her to a movie
And when her cover's blown
He took her to a movie
But so did I
There's nothing on TV
He took her to a movie
But she's the one for me
He took her to a movie
We're at number three
He took her to a movie
But so did I
